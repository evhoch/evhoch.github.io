    <section class="about-content">
        <p>Iâ€™m Evan Hoch, an Air Force Academy cadet, outdoor enthusiast, and data scientist passionate about solving real-world problems with data.<br> Outside of my studies, I am an avid cross country and downhill skier, ultimate frisbee player, and leader in my units. <br> Below, you can see me posing with my Basic Cadet Training Flight, a group of freshmen that I led this past summer, teaching them what it means to be a member of the military. You can also see the Cross Country Ski team, of which I am the captain, after racing at the club National Championship in Mammoth, California, and the Ultimate Frisbee team after a successful tournament in Wisconsin. <br> Lastly, you can see me in the San Juan Mountains posing with my back country ski gear in the middle of 4 day ski trip. </p>
